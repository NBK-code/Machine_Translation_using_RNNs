## Machine Translation using RNNs

We build a neural machine translation model using RNNs. In particular we use LSTM layers to perform English to German translation. The model is trained and evaluated on the language dataset from http://www.manythings.org/anki/. This dataset consists of over 200,000 pairs of sentences in English and German. But we work with a subset of the data to simplify training.
